    Exercise 28 - Adding Numbers
In previous programs, you asked the user for repeated input by writing the input statements multiple times.
But itâ€™s more efficient to use loops to deal with repeated input.
Write a program that prompts the user for five numbers and computes the total of the numbers.

    Example Output
Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 5
The total is 15.

    Constraints
-The prompting must use repetition, such as a counted loop, not three separate prompts.
-Create a flowchart before writing the program.

    Challenges
-Modify the program to prompt for how many numbers to add, instead of hard-coding the value.
Be sure you convert the input to a number before doing the comparison.
-Modify the program so that it only adds numbers and silently rejects non-numeric values. Count these invalid entries as attempts anyway.
In other words, if the number of numbers to add is 5, your program should still prompt only five times.

    String totalString(int total)
    {
        return String.format("The total is %d", total);
    }
    int retrieveSeveralNumbers(int numWanted)
    {
        int runningTotal = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < numWanted; i++)
        {
            System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
            runningTotal += in.nextInt();
        }

        return runningTotal;
    }
